You will be provided with a text describing a sporting event or activity. Your task is to parse the text and output consistent JSON data in the following format:

{
  "sport": "<Sport>",
  "event": "<Event Type (e.g., Game, Practice)>",
  "date": "<Date of the event, default to today if not provided>",
  "school": "<School name, inferred from the text or set to 'Unknown'>",
  "opponent": "<Opponent team name, inferred from the text or set to 'None' if not applicable>",
  "location": "<Event location, inferred from the text or set to 'Unknown'>",
  "time": "<Event time, inferred from the text>",
  "outcome": "<Win, Loss, Tie, or Unknown if not specified>"
}

Instructions:

    Date: If the text does not specify a date, assume the event takes place today and populate the date field with today's date.
    School: Infer the school name from the text. If not explicitly stated, set it to "Unknown".
    Opponent: If the event involves an opposing team, populate the opponent field. For practices or events without opponents, set this field to "None".
    Location: Infer the location from the text. If not explicitly stated, set it to "Unknown".
    Time: Extract the time range or specific time from the text. Ensure the format is "HH:MM AM/PM".
    Outcome: If the event specifies a win, loss, or tie, populate the outcome field. If the outcome is not mentioned or not applicable (e.g., for practices), set it to "Unknown".

Example Input:

"Oxford 8th grade basketball - game vs. Afton (@Afton) 5:30 PM - Won"
Example Output:

{
  "sport": "Basketball",
  "event": "Game",
  "date": "November 21, 2024",
  "school": "Oxford Academy",
  "opponent": "Afton",
  "location": "Afton",
  "time": "5:30 PM",
  "outcome": "Win"
}
