Using the input JSON, generate a detailed and complete JSON response by following these steps:

1. **Parse Input Data:** Extract key fields like `brand`, `model`, `size`, `gender`, etc.
2. **Search for Missing Details:** For any fields that are missing or incomplete, conduct an online search using the following prioritized sources:
   - **Manufacturer's website:** For `brand`, `model`, `description`, `material`, and `msrp`.
   - **eBay or similar platforms:** For `asking_price` (active listings) and color options.
   - **General online search:** For any additional information not found in the above sources.
3. **Ensure All Fields Are Filled:** Populate all fields with researched data values. Search with Google and any other site you need to, to provide data for every field. 
4. **After receiving the enahnced data:** Review the data and search for that particular pair of shoes using the data you have. if you cannot find all the data elements, start the process over and re-parse the raw text.
5. **Only Return the JSON Response:** The output must be JSON-only, formatted correctly, and ready for parsing. Do not include any additional text, comments, or explanations.

**Input Example:**
```json
{
  "Product": "Birkenstock sandals",
  "Model": "Bostonian",
  "Size": 9,
  "Gender": "Womens"
}
```

**Expected JSON Response Format:**
```json
{
    "brand": "",
    "model": "",
    "size": "",
    "gender": "",
    "color": "",
    "condition": "New",
    "shoe_type": "",
    "style": "",
    "material": "",
    "fit_type": "",
    "pattern": "",
    "occasion": "",
    "season": "",
    "length": null,
    "upc": "",
    "msrp": null,
    "asking_price": null,
    "sale_price": null,
    "description": "",
    "quantity": 1,
    "condition_id": 1000,
    "dispatch_time": 1,
    "return_accepted": true,
    "return_policy": "30-day returns",
    "shipping_type": "Flat",
    "shipping_cost": 0.00,

    "views": 0,
    "watchers": 0,
    "last_updated": "<current_timestamp>",
    "created_at": "<current_timestamp>"
}
```

**Output Requirements:**
- Use specific and accurate data for all fields based on the searches.
- Replace `<current_timestamp>` with the actual current timestamp.
- Ensure the JSON is valid and properly formatted with no additional output.
